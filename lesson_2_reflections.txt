1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git init transforms directory into git repository (creates .git subdirectory with all needed for repository data). Initialization of repo allows to start tracking files and perform commits.

2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area helps to provide "logical change-one commit" style of commiting and gives flexibility and control. Repository=all files in directory, working area=changed and working on files, staging area=files prepared for next commit.
